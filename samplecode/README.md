# PyPDF4 Sample Code Folder
This folder contains demonstrations of just a few of PyPDF4's many features.


## How to run
Invoke the Python interpeter you prefer by specifying the script you wish to
run, e.g.:
```
python2 ./samplecode/basic_features.py
python3 ./samplecode/basic_features.py
``` 

## `basic_features.py`

Sample code that demonstrates:

* Getting metadata from a PDF.
* Copying a PDF, one page at a time, and performing different operations on each page (resize, rotate, add a watermark).
* Encrypting a PDF.
* Adding javascript that runs when the PDF is opened.


## `basic_merging.py`

Sample code that demonstrates merging together three PDFs into one, picking and choosing which pages appear in which order.
Selected pages can be added to the end of the output PDF being built, or inserted in the middle.
